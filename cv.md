<p> My current goal is to learn and understand Javascript a little bit better. Later on I wish to learn more about React and Typescript, since it is used by developers at my job. What drives me to learn front-end and be good at it is the fact, that at my job right now we don't have any front-end developers,so I was given the opportunity to do some small front-end tasks. After succesfully completing the tasks, it made me feel accomplished and proud of myself. That feeling is the best motivation towards my the path of succession, because not only it proves, that I am capable of coding, but also that I enjoy coding. </p>
<div> Skills: </div>
<div> Basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages. </div>

<p> Unfortunately I can't show my latest code examples, because it is considered classified information, because I did them for work, but I can show latest Javacript code I did in freecodecamp.org course called 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures'. Keep in mind, in this website for Javascript you only need to add couple code lines: </p>
<div> userObj.data.friends.push(friend); </div>
<div> return userObj.data.friends; </div>
